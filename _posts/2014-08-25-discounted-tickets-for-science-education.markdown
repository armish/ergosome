I do terrible when it comes to application for fellowships.
I applied to seven different Ph.D. programs, but got officially accepted only by [one](http://www.triiprograms.org/cbm/) for which I had to appeal to their initial rejection.
I tried applying to [HHMI's International Student Research Fellowship](https://www.hhmi.org/programs/international-student-research-fellowships),
but [my institution](http://weill.cornell.edu/) did not nominate me for application.
I then applied to an internal fellowship at [my other institution](http://www.mskcc.org/) thinking that my chances would be higher given relatively smaller applicant pool.
I got rejected, but was *strongly encouraged* to apply for next year's fellowship.
After [lots of thinking](https://www.pubchase.com/career/question/do-non-prestigious-pre-doctoral-fellowships-help-with-findin-162), I applied next year with high hopes and got rejected again.
I also took my chances at [a research paper prize](https://www.facebook.com/weillcornellgradschool/posts/1480330052202268) with [my recently published work](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/14/2051), but alas.

So when I first heard about this year's [Lasker Essay Contest](http://www.laskerfoundation.org/programs/contest.htm),
I tried not to get so excited, but I made my mind and gave it a try. 
Today I got the news that the essay I submitted was not selected
and [as I promised](https://twitter.com/armish/status/496657681772322816), I decided to make a blog post out of it.
The silver lining is that I now have yet another public file on [FigShare](http://figshare.com/articles/Discounted_Tickets_for_Science_Education/1150282)
and the visibility of this essay will hopefully be much higher with this post.

For those of you that are curious, (*drum rolls please*) [here](http://figshare.com/articles/Discounted_Tickets_for_Science_Education/1150282) is my essay on *innovative ways to build support and ensure funding for medical research* -- ah, the irony...:
