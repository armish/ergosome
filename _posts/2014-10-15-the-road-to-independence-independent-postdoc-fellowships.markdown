*I am a fifth-year graduate student ... and considering applying for such and such fellowships...* 
So starts my e-mail messages to program coordinators nowadays.
I am now officially a senior student in the Ph.D. program and on average, this is the year I should wrap things up and start thinking about *the next step*.
And I am.
And it is taking a lot of time and effort to do these things.
And there is definitely no good guide for what I am trying to do.
This is exactly why I decided to go transparent about this process
and blog about certain aspects of applying for an independent postdoc fellowship, right off of graduate school.

Everything started with me coming across [Ethan Perlstein](http://www.ethanperlstein.com/)'s [Crowdsourcing Discovery](http://www.rockethub.com/projects/11106-crowdsourcing-discovery) project.
I really liked the idea of supporting a science project like this 
and getting a 3D-printed methamphetamine molecule as a bonus.
So I backed the project.
Fast-forward a few months and I received an e-mail from Ethan about his being in the city 
and checking the possibility for a meet up so that he could give me the gift.
This was extremely timely, 
because we happened to be looking for new presenters for a science discussion club we had been running at our lab.
So I replied back to him asking whether he was willing to present his work
and he agreed to do so.
And right before I sent [his CV](http://www.ethanperlstein.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Perlstein_CV.pdf) to our group for the introduction,
I found myself googling [Lewis-Sigler Fellowship](http://www.princeton.edu/genomics/lewis-sigler-fellows/) to see what kind of a fellowship it was.

At that point, my third year in the graduate program, 
I absolutely was not even thinking about graduation, leave alone where to apply next.
I did know that I wanted to do a post-doc and stay in academia for good,
but before then, I didn't know about the possibility of becoming an independent post-doc.
So I started asking people about the advantages and disadvantages of these fellowships.
After a fruitful discussion with [Lenny Teytelman](https://twitter.com/lteytelman),
I made up my mind and [posted a question](https://www.pubchase.com/career/question/from-a-naive-point-of-view-independent-post-doc-fellowships-196) about these fellowships on [PubChase](https://www.pubchase.com/career/question/from-a-naive-point-of-view-independent-post-doc-fellowships-196)
and got back really informative answers from former/current fellows.

After carefully considering these options and discussing future plans with [my dearest wife](https://twitter.com/PINPINPINN),
we decided that these fellowships were definitely worth applying for
before going for a traditional postdoc position.
Giving this decision was already a major thing,
but preparing the application turned out to be much harder than I anticipated.

As a graduate student who [previously applied for smallish fellowships but got rejected from all](http://ergoso.me/lasker/essay/rejection/2014/08/25/discounted-tickets-for-science-education.html),
and as a student who doesn't have much of an experience in terms of putting in successful grant applications,
you can probably feel my pain about working on a killer fellowship application.
And add my being international to the equation, which reduces the list of possible positions that I can apply to down to a handful.

Sure, there are really great resources out there talking about how funding mechanism works,
how to write successful grants
and how to better apply for faculty positions (see [Dr. Becca's advice aggregator](http://drbecca.scientopia.org/tt-job-search-advice-aggregator/) for more).
There are even more of these on [the start-up culture](http://startupclass.samaltman.com/),
but it turns out that there is no such resource for people like me.

I am also a huge fan of [Alex Blumberg](https://twitter.com/abexlumberg)'s [incredible podcast](http://hearstartup.com/) on starting a business and
as I listen to him talking about his experience, I realized many similarities between his and mine.
This got me thinking about becoming transparent about this whole application process
and document things along the way.
I might not get any of the fellowships,
so I don't know if this blog series is going to be about a successful or a failed application;
but, I am hoping that it will prove useful for somebody who is thinking about becoming an independent postdoc.
